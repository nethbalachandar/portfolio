This is a placeholder for the wafer defect detection CNN output image.

In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image showing:
- Original wafer image with defects
- Processed image with detected defects highlighted
- Bounding boxes around identified defect regions
- Classification labels for each defect type
- Confidence scores for predictions

The image should demonstrate the CNN's ability to:
1. Accurately detect various defect types (cracks, voids, scratches)
2. Localize defects with precise bounding boxes
3. Classify defects with high confidence scores
4. Handle multiple defects in a single wafer image

Replace this file with an actual PNG showing your model's output visualization.
